# DEEP WORK TRACKER
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/2cY0h8IHdbo
#### Description:
After reading the book Deep Work by Cal Newport I a have leard about the importance of focus and purpose working.
I have created this web app to be able to record the number of daily 25 minutes work sessions I do with a social feature to be able to see and compare how much your friends are also working.

I have used all the main web app tools learned in CS50 (CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Flask, Html). On top of this I have added the javasript chart library chart.js.


The program has an application.py where the backend logic is build.
I then has the different html screens saved on the templates folder.
I have tried to put duplicated logic all together in helper functions that are saved in the static folder and the helpers.py doc.

Thank you
